MyGallery is a simple slideshow gallery written in plain HTML, CSS and javascript.

The aim of this little website is to provide a clean and responsive layout, which remains consistent on any possible device.

Due to the plain JS realisation MyGallery is easy to implement in other projects, even if written using more complicated frameworks.

The CSS-code behind the fade effects remain consistent with different timeframes. This mean if you´d like to change the cycling-duration you´ll just need to modify the JS code at line 18
